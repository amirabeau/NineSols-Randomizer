# NineSols-Randomizer
This is a simple randomizer project for Nine Sols developped as part of a hack day event. This mod randomly replaces items with each other but does not include any logic for item placement. This means that item arrangements generated by this mod will often result in unwinnable game states. 

# Build Setup
1. Copy Assembly-CSharp.dll, rcg.rcgmakercore.Runtime.dll and Sirenix.OdinInspector.Attributes.dll into the lib folder from your local Nine Sols installation.
   Example path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Nine Sols\NineSols_Data\Managed
2. Open NineSolsRandomizer.sln with visual studio
3. Build
